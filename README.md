# angular-CRUD
This is like SPA(single page web application).

This  demo is good for beginner.

here I designed Angular form and Table. user can insert or update record using same form only.

There are input box, radio button and **dropdown** available in form.
when user click on edit recort it fill that information to form.and change add button into update button.
you can change and update that record.
